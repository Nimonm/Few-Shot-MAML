# Few-Shot-MAML
A temp repo for collaboration within Camp 9.

Note:
Before kicking off, you should create our trainval dataset under the "data" directory in the first place.
Make sure the folder name is consistent with the option from the "datasource" parameter.

For training:
python main.py --logdir=path/to/your/log/directory (The other parameters have been set by default.)

For testing:
python main.py --train=False --test_set=True

Good luck!
